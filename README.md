ðŸ•’ Digital Clock - Description
This is a simple web-based digital clock that displays the current time in HH:MM:SS format.

HTML creates the structure of the clock.

CSS styles the clock to look clean and centered on the page.

JavaScript handles the real-time functionality by updating the time every second using setInterval() and Date().

It's a great beginner project to practice DOM manipulation, time functions, and basic styling.
